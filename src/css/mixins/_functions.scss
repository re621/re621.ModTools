// Utility functions

// This was a fix to a unicode character problem in the older version of the script.
// However, the webpack does not seem to experience the same issue. Somehow.
// Moreover, keeping the function as-is broke the rest of the stylesheet. Somehow.
// For posterity: https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/1395
@function unicode($str) {
    @return "\\"+$str;
    // @return unquote("\"")+unquote(str-insert($str, "\\", 1))+unquote("\"");
}
